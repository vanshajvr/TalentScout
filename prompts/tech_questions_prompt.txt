You are assisting in a technical screening interview.

Candidate details:
- Desired role: {role}
- Years of experience: {experience}
- Tech stack: {tech_stack}

Task:
Generate 3 to 5 technical interview questions for EACH major technology in the tech stack.

Guidelines:
- Questions must match the candidate’s experience level.
- Avoid trivial or definition-only questions.
- Prioritize questions that assess real-world experience, debugging ability,
design trade-offs, and decision-making in production or project settings.
- Avoid purely textbook or algorithm-only questions unless directly relevant
to the role.
- Do not include answers.
- Clearly group questions by technology.
- Keep questions concise and professional.
- Assume the candidate has already completed tutorials; test depth, not familiarity.
- Do not explicitly mention the experience level in the questions.

Difficulty Adjustment:
- If experience < 1 year: focus on fundamentals and basic usage.
- If experience between 1–3 years: focus on applied concepts, debugging, and best practices.
- If experience > 3 years: focus on design trade-offs, performance, and real-world constraints.


Output only the questions.
